# Text-Classification-Project-NLP

Description:
This project develops a machine learning model to automatically classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyze textual data to understand sentiment expressed in movie reviews. The model processes a pre-processed dataset from Cornell University, which consists of 2000 movie reviews, categorized evenly as positive and negative. Key NLP methods used include text normalization, vectorization, and classification algorithms, providing a hands-on approach to understanding sentiment analysis in NLP.
